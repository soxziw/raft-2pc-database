// Test: Concurrent intra-shard transactions with partial failure (test_concurrent_intra_shard_partial_failure)
// Description: This test performs two concurrent intra-shard transactions:
// 1. Account 100 attempts to transfer $12 to account 200 within Cluster 0
// 2. Account 1500 transfers $2 to account 1600 within Cluster 1
// The first transaction should fail because the amount ($12) exceeds account 100's balance,
// while the second transaction should succeed. This tests the system's ability to handle
// concurrent transactions where one fails without affecting the other independent transaction.
