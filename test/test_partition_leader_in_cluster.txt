// Test: Partition leader in a cluster (test_partition_leader_in_cluster)
// Description: This test simulates a network partition by stopping the leader (server 0) in Cluster 0,
// then performs a transaction where account 200 transfers $1 to account 100.
// The transaction should still succeed because the Raft consensus protocol will elect a new leader
// among the remaining nodes, demonstrating the system's ability to maintain availability
// and consistency despite leader failures.
// Commands:
// stop 0  // Stop server 0 (leader) in Cluster 0
