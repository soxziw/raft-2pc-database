// Test: Raft failure in intra-shard transaction (test_raft_failure_in_intra_shard)
// Description: This test simulates a majority failure in Cluster 0 by stopping 2 out of 3 nodes,
// then attempts a transaction where account 200 transfers $1 to account 100.
// The transaction should fail because Raft consensus requires a majority of nodes to be operational.
// This tests the system's behavior when a shard loses quorum and cannot process transactions.
// Commands:
// stop 1  // Stop server 1 in Cluster 0
// stop 2  // Stop server 2 in Cluster 0
