// Test: Concurrent cross-shard transactions with partial failure (test_concurrent_cross_shard_partial_failure)
// Description: This test executes two concurrent cross-shard transactions:
// 1. Account 100 (Cluster 0) transfers $1 to account 1500 (Cluster 1) - Should succeed
//    because account 100 has sufficient balance for this small transaction.
// 2. Account 200 (Cluster 0) transfers $11 to account 1600 (Cluster 1) - Should fail
//    because account 200 has insufficient balance (default balance is $10).
// This test verifies that the 2PC protocol correctly handles concurrent transactions
// with mixed outcomes, ensuring atomicity for each individual transaction.
