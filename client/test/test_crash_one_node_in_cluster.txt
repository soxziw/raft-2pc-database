// Test: Crash one node in a cluster (test_crash_one_node_in_cluster)
// Description: This test simulates a failure by crashing 1 out of 3 nodes in Cluster 0,
// then performs a transaction where account 200 transfers $1 to account 100.
// The transaction should still succeed because the Raft consensus protocol
// can tolerate the failure of a minority of nodes (1 out of 3) while maintaining
// system availability and consistency.
// Commands:
// stop 1  // Stop server 1 in Cluster 0
