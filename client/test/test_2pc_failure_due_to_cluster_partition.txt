// Test: 2PC transaction failure due to cluster partition (test_2pc_failure_due_to_cluster_partition)
// Description: This test simulates a network partition where Cluster 1 (C1) becomes
// completely isolated from the network. All servers in C1 (servers 3, 4, and 5) are
// stopped to simulate this partition. The cross-shard transaction between accounts
// 200 and 1500 should fail because C1 is unreachable during the 2PC protocol.
// Commands:
// stop 3  // Stop server 3 in Cluster 1
// stop 4  // Stop server 4 in Cluster 1
// stop 5  // Stop server 5 in Cluster 1
