// Test: Concurrent cross-shard transactions both commit (test_concurrent_cross_shard_both_commit)
// Description: This test executes two concurrent cross-shard transactions:
// 1. Account 100 (Cluster 0) transfers $1 to account 1500 (Cluster 1)
// 2. Account 200 (Cluster 0) transfers $4 to account 1600 (Cluster 1)
// Both transactions should commit successfully as they involve different accounts
// with sufficient balances, demonstrating the system's ability to handle
// multiple concurrent cross-shard transactions using the 2PC protocol.
