// Test: Basic intra-shard transaction success (test_basic_intra_shard_success)
// Description: This test performs a transaction between account 100 and account 200
// within the same shard (Cluster 0) with an amount of $3. The transaction should succeed
// because account 100 has sufficient balance and both accounts are in the same shard,
// which means it can be processed directly by the Raft consensus protocol without
// requiring the 2PC protocol.
