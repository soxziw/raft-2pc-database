// Test: Concurrent intra-shard transactions both commit (test_concurrent_intra_shard_both_commit)
// Description: This test performs two concurrent intra-shard transactions:
// 1. Account 100 transfers $4 to account 200 within Cluster 0
// 2. Account 1500 transfers $2 to account 1600 within Cluster 1
// Both transactions should commit successfully since they operate on different shards
// and don't interfere with each other. This tests the system's ability to handle
// multiple independent transactions occurring simultaneously.
