// Test: Basic cross-shard transaction success (test_basic_cross_shard_success)
// Description: This test performs a cross-shard transaction between account 100 (in Cluster 0)
// and account 1500 (in Cluster 1) with an amount of $2. The transaction should succeed
// because account 100 has sufficient balance and both accounts are available for the
// transaction, allowing the 2PC protocol to complete successfully.
